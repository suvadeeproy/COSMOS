# COSMOS — Physics‑Plus Build (v6)

This release upgrades the **math/physics rigor** of the in‑app discussions: each page now includes
lightweight derivations, key equations, and interpretation guidance tied directly to the displayed plots.

## Run
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
streamlit run app.py
```

## Notes
- Designed to run on Streamlit Community Cloud free tier (no heavy downloads by default).
- Optional real exoplanet data requires `lightkurve` (not installed by default in this build).
